Purpose
Webshame is an extension you can download and configure to send notifications to other friends in your webshame circle when you have exceeded the time you have allotted yourself on a given site. Your friends will then shame you for being so weak as to succumb to 3 hours on reddit. This is all to utilize social pressure to make you use the internet more responsibly.
